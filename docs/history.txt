24-Oct-2001:
	- Added the very first code for CEL. Today I added:
	    - The include files for PL and BL. These are SCF interfaces.
	    - The start of PLIMP which is the implementation of the PL.
	    - The start of CELTEST which is a test application for CEL.
	  The test application works (i.e. it opens a CS window) but other
	  than that there is nothing functional yet.
	- Fixed a bug in factory definition of 'plimp'.
	- Started work on 'bltest'.
