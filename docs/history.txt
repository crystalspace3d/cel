11-Jan-2003
	- Release of CEL 0.96r001.
24-Jan-2003
	- Eric Sunshine updated Makefile to work correctly with new -makevars
	  fragments from cs-config which might now contain references to
	  makefile variables such as $(OUT), $(CFLAGS.I), $(LFLAGS.L), etc.
23-Jan-2003:
	- Keith Fulton added a SetID to iCelEntity so it is possible
	  for an external app to override the CS_ID assigned to an
	  entity.  This is necessary when objects across networks
	  have different lifespans, to prevent reuse of the same CS_ID
	  to represent different objects and confusion of the 
	  underlying entities.
	- Matthias Braun then reverted this change based on design
	  principles. Jorrit agrees.
	- Jorrit then put back Keith's patch after discussion with Matthias.
	  It seems to be the only fast solution to solve the problem right now.
	  It is a hack though and another solution MUST be found.
	  Personally I feel most for letting NumReg return numbers that
	  are never reused. Perhaps requires some thinking.
21-Jan-2003:
	- Fixed a ref leak on 'view' in the engine property class.
	  The 'new csView' wasn't properly embedded in a csPtr<iView>.
17-Jan-2003:
	- Keith Fulton fixed circular refcount issue which prevented all
	  prop class factories from ever being deleted.
	- Keith Fulton added many specific error msgs for things which 
	  could go wrong with CEL persistence loading on the client.
	  Added a Report function to all files involved which should
	  probably be in a libary, but he cannot create the library on
	  on Windows himself.
15-Jan-2003:
	- Fixed CEL for latest CS changes (growing arrays).
	- In the mean time fixed some memory leaks while doing that.
13-Jan-2003:
	- Fixed the python plugin.
07-Jan-2003:
 	- Keith Fulton added a SetReverseAction convenience function to iPcMesh.
05-Jan-2003:
	- Keith Fulton changed iPcCamera to not always require an iPcRegion.
30-Dec-2002:
	- Matze fixed several refcount problems introduced by the change to
	  csRef. But still a leak here :-/
24-Dec-2002:
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a small compilation error in pf/mesh/
	  meshfact.cpp, introduced by the separation of Engine and Thing
	  in CS.
01-Oct-2002:
	- Keith Fulton added Yaw (Y-axis) adjustment to iPcCamera.  Yaw,
	  Pitch and Roll together change the camera viewing angle without
	  affecting the LookAt vector.
20-Sep-2002:
	- Patch from Michael Dale Long for improved Python support
		- Added embedded iScript interface to celBlPython.  Now
		  applications can get access to the underlying scripting
		  interface if one is available.
		- Modified CreateBehaviour() so it passes an iCelEntity
		  instead of an iCelEntity * to the behaviour constructor.
		  This frees the scriptwriter from having to wrap the pointer
		  before using it.
		- Added some csQueryRegistry_* functions.  This is to 
		  facilitate a Python csQueryRegistry() function that performs
		  CS_QUERY_REGISTRY() type lookups.
		- Added the LoadBehaviour() method to iCelEntity to simplify
		  loading and setting behaviours in scripts.  Note that
		  actions in the behaviour may or may not take affect in the
		  running environment depending on how you run the interpreter.
		- Added celCreate* (i.e. celCreateEntity, celCreateCamera) to
		  simplify creation of these objects in a script.
		- Removed iCelBehaviour::SendMessageV() wrapper and added a 
		  wrapper for SendMessage() which excludes the varargs.
		- Added celQueryPC_iPcRegion() to facilitate a Python
		  celQueryPC() function that performs CEL_QUERY_PROPCLASS()
		  type lookups.
		- Added scfQuery_iPcRegion() to facilitate a Python
		  scfQuery() function that performs SCF_QUERY_INTERFACE()
		  type lookups.
		- Added wrappers for iPcRegion, iPcCamera, iPcMeshSelect, 
		  iPcMesh, iPcTimer, iPcSolid, iPcGravity, iPcMovable, 
		  iPcInventory, and iPcCharacteristics.  Each one has a
		  corresponding celCreate* function.
17-Sep-2002:
	- Fixed CEL for the new csPtr(csRef) constructor in CS.
13-Sep-2002:
	- Did a full smart pointer fix for entire CEL.
20-Aug-2002:
	- MatzeB removed broken automake system and replaced it with a Jam
	  and autoconf based one
19-Jul-2002:
	- MatzeB fixed indentation and an LPVOID issue in engfact.cpp.
	- Readded the firstperson camera mode that I accidently removed
	  yesterday by applying's Anders patch.
18-Jul-2002:
	- Several months ago I received a patch from Anders Stenberg.
	  This patch does the following:
	      - Added the blcel.physicallayer_ptr variable so that python
	        scripts can access the pl more easily.
	      - blpython.i contains lots more interfaces to CEL stuff
	        (entities and property classes).
	      - Getting a description string of a property. Will be useful
	        for stuff like entity editors/viewers (within a level
		editor for example).
	      - Enable the subclass to just "register" a property, bind it
	        to one of its members, and then all handling of
		SetProperty/GetProperty is done "automatically". (Of course
		it can be overloaded if you want some special voodoo. For
		example, you can handle just one property with some special
		stuff, and release it to celPcCommon::SetProperty in all other
		cases.)
	      - pcregion uses the new system described above.
2-Jul-2002:
	- Fixed CEL for the latest CS changes with regards to the _FAST
	  macros.
11-Jun-2002:
	- pcmovable property class now fires a callback with ID
	  CEL_PCMOVEABLE_PROPERTY_POSITION whenever the position is changed
	  in preparation for pclocater.
10-Jun-2002:
	- Added first person camera mode from amin
5-Jun-2002:
	- Added CreateEmptyEntityList() to the pl in CEL.
28-May-2002:
	- Fixed include for polymesh.h.
	- pcmesh property class now fires a callback with ID
	  CEL_PCMESH_PROPERTY_MESH whenever the mesh changes.
22-Apr-2002:
	- Fixed several bad bugs in NumReg:
	    - In Register() a 'memset' was done with only
	      (newsize-listsize) bytes but this needs to multiply
	      by the size of (void*).
	    - 'memset' was also done on the OLD value of 'list' so this
	      could potentially corrupt memory if a reallocation caused
	      in a new pointer.
	    - 'freelistend' points to the first free item in 'freelist'.
	      However the loop in Register() was first doing 'freelistend++'
	      which means there was a gap.
15-Apr-2002:
	- Matze removed some warning printfs
30-Mar-2002:
	- Matze added an extra parameter to pcmesh->SetAction. If resetaction
	  is false like the default it doesn't set the action if it's the same
	  like the current action
26-Mar-2002:
	- Matze added a RemoveEntity callback, that makes it possible for the
	  persistance layer contexts to only keep soft refs to entities
	- Applied a patch from Loic Dachary, it adds autoconf support to cel
	  which brings a nice install and build system (on platforms that
	  support autoconf/automake). He also included the license into some
	  headers that missed it... I just replaced the COPYING file by a
	  LGPL one...
6-Mar-2002:
	- Matze made the internal mapping of persistance (ids from localhost
	  to ids from other host) accessible through some functions in
	  iCelPersistContext. You can now also choose if mapping should be
	  used. By default mapping is performed while loading a file and not
	  while reading one.
5-Mar-2002:
	- Added iPcCamera::GetFollowPos() and GetMode().
	- Matze fixed pckeyinput for latest CS changes
28-Feb-2002:
	- Matze changed persistance to not IncRef entities while reading,
	  everyone who reads an entity with persistance has to IncRef this
	  itself now. On the other hand this solves an issue when multiple
	  persisted things refer to the same entity. Note that this is only for
	  datatbuffers, the LoadEntity function still returns an IncReffed
	  entity.
	- Matze added Clear to persistace context to clear the internal hash
	  tables of the persistance plugin.
27-Feb-2002:
	- Matze fixed a wrong return.
	- Matze removed the persistance Set(int) function.
	- Fixed the python behaviour layer.
	- Added some sanity checks to NumReg code using CS_ASSERT.
	- fixed a bug in camera persistance
26-Feb-2002:
	- improved followmode. It now accepts 2 relative positions:
	    -the position of the camera relative to the mesh
	    -the position of the point the camera looks at, rel. to the mesh	
21-Feb-2002:
	- Renamed celData->Set(bool) to SetBool() to avoid problems on
	  platforms that don't have the bool type.
20-Feb-2002:
	- Fixed a bug in celPcRegion::SetWorldFile() it would delete
	  its own copy in some cases.
	- Did some small reformatting of history.txt.
19-Feb-2002:
	- jtarbox added a rotational camera mode a few days back and then
	  changed it so that the distance from the object can be changed as
	  well.
12-Fev-2002:
	- Matze changed order of entity saving/loading. behaviour is the last
	  processed piece now.
20-Jab-2002:
	- Matze changed ref behaviour for Region: Camera is taken ref to
	  region now. This fixes camera loading.
17-Jan-2002:
	- Matze fixed several bugs/cleaned up/commented in ID registry
	- introduced celDataBufHelper class to make the Save/Load functions
	  easier
	- more fixes, persistance at least doesn't crash anymore now
15-Jan-2002:
	- Fixed more of the bugs I introduced and cleaned stuff up alot
	- persistance is working now, but some property classes seem to be
	  buggy
	- reenabled the csMemFile buffer, after fixing a bug in CS
14-Jan-2002:
	- Matze changed persistance plugin, to accept streams thourgh iFile
	  interface.
	- Also changed persistance to use ID's instead of entity names
	- Added some macros that help debugging save/load functions
	- Saving seems to work, while loading fails for some reasons... I
	  suspect a bug in csMemFile (I'll investigate tomorrow), but also
	  when reading files directly from disk something goes still wrong...
7-Jan-2002:
	- Updated CEL for new CS.
2-Jan-2002:
	- Matze added support for ID's:
	     Each Entity is assigned a unique ID now, a list of ID's is
	     stored in the PhysicalLayer now, so this also has the nice
	     effect, that you can check if all entities are properly removed
	     at destruction time.
	- Matze added CEL_DEBUG constant.
31-Dec-2001:
	- The new 'pcgravity2' property class works a lot better now with
	  the new CollidePath() function in CS iCollideSystem. Friction
	  and proper collision response still have to be implemented though.
	- Again improved gravity handling a little.
	- Removed the old celPcGravity and renamed celPcGravity2 to
	  celPcGravity.
	- Renamed iPcGravity::IsOnGround() to IsResting() to indicate if
	  an object is resting.
	- Added iPcGravity::ApplyPermanentForce() and
	  iPcGravity::ClearPermanentForces() to work with permanent forces.
	- Added iPcGravity::SetActive() and IsActive() with which you can
	  activate/deactivate physics handling for that object temporarily.
	- Added iPcGravity::ResetSpeed(). This will leave the forces alone
	  but reset the speed to zero.
	- iPcGravity::ClearForces() will no longer reset the speed.
29-Dec-2001:
	- Philip Wyett updated MSVC project files for CEL.
28-Dec-2001:
	- Renamed 'pcinput_' messages to 'pckeyinput_'.
	- Implemented persistance in pckeyinput property class.
	- Added the first version of the 'blpython' plugin. This is
	  a general behaviour layer for python scripting. It compiles
	  and links but it otherwise not functional.
	- Further work on the blpython layer. It now actually implements
	  iCelBlLayer correctly and also returns iCelBehaviour instances.
	- Added GetName() to iCelBlLayer. Behaviour layers can now have
	  names. This allows CEL to distinguish between different behaviour
	  layers that may be loaded at the same time.
	- Added a registry of behaviour layers to the physical layer.
	- Added GetBehaviourLayer() function to iCelBehaviour.
	- Made the persistance plugin independent from the behaviour
	  layer that is chosen by also writing and reading the name
	  of the behaviour layer. This allows persistance to work correctly
	  if multiple behaviour layers are in memory (and behaviours from
	  various behaviour layers are used).
	- The python behaviour layer plugin is now actually working and
	  being used for two small entities.
	- Started work on a new pcgravity property classes (for now
	  called pcgravity2 until it is working fine and can replace the
	  old pcgravity). Celtest already uses this new property class
	  for a all entities and it seems to work a bit already.
	  Note that it is highly unfinished though!
27-Dec-2001:
	- Added a string registry to the physical layer. This can be used
	  for various things but in the first time it is going to be used
	  for a generic property setter for all property classes. CEL
	  convention on string names will be 'cel.xxx.yyy.zzz'. With 'xxx'
	  equal to the type of string (i.e. 'property'), 'yyy' equal to the
	  scope of the property (i.e. 'pccamera') and 'zzz' the name of the
	  given type (i.e. the property name). An example:
	  'cel.property.pccamera.startsector'.
	- Extended iCelPropertyClass with a number of methods for a generic
	  property setter. This will allow string based scripting languages
	  to access all property classes without requiring knowledge
	  of the SCF interface that is specific to that property class. Of
	  course it will be less efficient but the efficiency loss is solved
	  a bit by using the string registry.
	- celPcCommand already provides empty implementations of all
	  these new classes so that existing property classes don't have
	  to be modified. None of the property classes currently implement
	  the new interface though.
	- Implemented the new property interface in celPcRegion. It now
	  supports the following three properties:
	    cel.property.pcregion.worlddir
	    cel.property.pcregion.worldfile
	    cel.property.pcregion.regionname
	- Added support for csVector3 as a type for properties in
	  iCelPropertyClass.
	- Added a PerformAction() function to iCelPropertyClass which uses
	  the same system as the properties in iCelPropertyClass and allows
	  scripting languages to perform generic actions. Convention for
	  action names is:
	    cel.action.pcregion.load
	  Actions are included with properties in the rest of the API.
	  So you can also perform the following functions on actions (note
	  that these functions have been renamed):
	    - HasPropertyOrAction()
	    - GetPropertyAndActionCount()
	    - GetPropertyOrActionID()
	    - GetPropertyOrActionType() (new function)
	- Added celPropertyActionType enumeration type.
	- Seperated celData and celDataType from persist.h into its own
	  pl/datatype.h.
	- There were already three places where some kind of datatype
	  was defined:
	    - persistance (celData and celDataType).
	    - iPcProperties (CEL_PROPERTY_... define).
	    - The new properties in iCelPropertyClass (type_...).
	  Rationalized this by using the celData and celDataType definitions
	  everywhere. To do this celDataType had to be extended with csVector3.
	- Updated the persistance layer to also support csVector3 directly
	  now (CEL_DATA_VECTOR3). Updated several of the property classes
	  load/save functions to use csVector3 instead of three floats.
	- Added CEL_DATA_ACTION to celDataType. This is not supported by
	  the persistance layer though and only needed for iCelPropertyClass.
	  Added celData->SetAction() to set an action.
	- Fixed a memory leak in the pcinput property class which was
	  not deleting the event handler.
	- Fixed a memory leak in celtest. The actor entity was not added
	  to the room inventory.
	- Changed persistance in pcgravity to use the new CEL_DATA_VECTOR3.
	- Fixed a few memory leaks in bltest.
	- Rationalized the SendMessage names to the convention:
		'pcbla_msgname'.
	  In particular for pcinput this means that some changes are
	  needed. Instead of +run (and similar) it will now be
	  	pcinput_run1 (and pcinput_run0 for disable).
	  This change was done to make the name compitible with scripting
	  language routines.
26-Dec-2001:
	- Added new iPcProperties property class. This is a general property
	  class to store string, float, long or boolean properties.
	  The message prop_setproperty is sent to the behaviour layer when
	  a property is set. The message prop_clearproperty is sent when
	  a property is cleared. The index of the property is given as
	  a parameter.
	- Added SetRectangle() to iPcCamera. With this you can set the part
	  of the screen that this camera will use. Also implemented
	  persistance.
	- Added persistance for the camera mode in iPcCamera implementation.
20-Dec-2001:
	- Matze added cel.cex, which makes cel usable together with cs-config.
16-Dec-2001:
	- Matze fixed a memory leak: pllayer was holding references to
	  factories and these to pl. Now only pllayer holds the ref.
	- Matze added a mode switch to camera property, in follow mode the
	  camera, stays behind it's assigned mesh and even does collision
	  detection.
14-Dec-2001:
	- Matze reports: keyboard input works now, but for some strange
	  reason CS transmits each key multiple times, and on the other side
	  when pressing a key only short it isn't transmitted sometimes...
	- Matze cleaned up celtest a bit.
12-Dec-2001:
	- Added iCelPropertyChangeCallback interface. Using this it will
	  be possible to listen to property changes in all property classes.
	- Extended iCelPropertyClass with methods to remove and add
	  callbacks.
	- Added pf/common directory containing common code for all property
	  class implementation. There is now a celPcCommon class which can
	  be used by a property class implementation to make things easier.
	  This celPcCommon already implements the two functions above
	  to handle the callbacks. In addition it also implements a
	  function to fire a callback.
	- Changed all current property class implementations to inherit
	  from celPcCommon.
	- Nothing is using this callback system at the moment.
	- Matze started work on keyboard input.
10-Dec-2001:
	- Matze added #defines for template Factories, you can now easily use
	  CEL_DECLARE_FACTORY(bla) and later CEL_IMPLEMENT_FACTORY(bla). Also
	  changed behaviour to register exact 1 Factory for each Property
	  class, which reduces the need for all the factory pointers.
		TODO: -Do the same for behaviour factory
		      -change FindPropertyClassFactory to use hash table to
		       speed the thing up.
		      -unreleased instances because some plugins implement
		       multiple components (at least I think it's because of
		       that)
7-Dec-2001:
	- Fixed for latest CS.
20-Nov-2001:
	- Added a minimal test level to make debugging easier.
	  You can enable this minimal test by defining MINIMAL as 1
	  in celtest.
	- Fixed a bad bug in the persistance loader. It was acccidently
	  adding every property class twice to the entity.
	- Fixed a ref count leak on entities in the inventory loader.
	- Fixed a bug in persistance layer which prevented persistance
	  from working properly. It turned out that the entity was not
	  set for the property classes.
	- Fixed a bug in the mesh loader. It would not correctly call
	  DeferUpdateLighting() after loading from the persistance layer.
	- Persistance is now ALMOST working. For simple situations I managed
	  to get it working fully.
	- Implemented correct persistence for pccamera so that the current
	  position of the camera is also remembered.
	- Fixed a crash bug in cel with persistance and inventory.
	  Related to ref counting again.
19-Nov-2001:
	- CS now has a feature to remove an object from the engine in general.
	  The plimp Cache will use that new function so that the extreme
	  hack I made yesterday can be avoided.
	- With some additional CS fixes there are now only two objects
	  (one material and one texture) that leak when celtest cleans
	  up game entity.
	- All leaks are now gone.
	- Philip Wyett updated MSVC project files for CEL.
18-Nov-2001:
	- Debugging with DG_TYPE for 'celEntity'.
	- Added 'c' key to clear game (debugging too).
	- Implemented an extreme hack in the cache. It turns out that you cannot
	  simply remove factory wrappers by doing DecRef() on them. You need
	  to remove them from the engine. I have to find a better solution
	  for this.
16-Nov-2001:
	- Implemented a cache in the physical layer. This cache will hold
	  objects of type iBase and keeps a reference to them. This cache
	  can be used to store pointers to objects that are useful in the
	  game and that you don't want to be removed while the game is
	  in progress even if the object is not used at some specific point.
	  A good example is mesh factories. Even though there may be no
	  mesh object using a particular mesh factory you still do not
	  want to delete the loaded mesh factory. Otherwise there would be
	  a delay when the factory is suddenly needed.
	- 'pcmesh' now uses this cache to store a reference to the factory
	  that is used. In addition every mesh that uses a mesh factory
	  will also increase the ref count. Added CleanCache() to celtest
	  so that the cache will be cleaned if a new game starts. This
	  solves another memory leak with the mesh object factories this
	  time.
	- celEntity (as implemented in plimp) is now also a csObject.
	- Added QueryObject() to iCelEntity.
	- Added more DG_LINK's to link more objects with each other.
	- Fixed a few links now that iCelEntity no longer is an iObject.
15-Nov-2001:
	- Fixed a memory leak in 'pctooltip' and 'pctimer' with event queue.
	- Added lots of DG_... lines to help debugging.
	- Fixed a bad memory leak in pcgravity. It was leaking the list
	  of entities returned by FindNearbyEntities().
	- Fixed huge memory leaks with the property classes caused by
	  the event handlers being embedded interfaces of the property classes.
	  The problem is that the event handlers were being unregistered
	  in the destructor of the property class. But since the event
	  handler was part of the property class and since the event queue
	  increments the reference of the event handler the ref count could
	  never get zero so the property class never got deleted.
	  Fixed this by making the event handlers seperate objects. This
	  means that additional references on them will not cause a higher
	  ref count for the property class.
	- Enabled persistance again (loading). Still crashes though.
	- Remove the region in pcregion::Unload().
	- Fixed another big memory leak in the gravity property class.
	  It was leaking pcsolid instances.
14-Nov-2001:
	- Few changes for debugging using the new graph debug tool in CS.
13-Nov-2001:
	- Modified pcmeshsel property class to work through
	  the pccamera property class instead of using iCamera
	  directly. This also fixes the bug with saving of the
	  pcmeshsel property class.
	- Added an event handler to pccamera. It is now responsible for
	  drawing and moving the camera. celtest no longer contains code
	  for this. In the future it will be possible to say how the camera
	  should move (first person, third person, fixed camera position,
	  user defined movement strategy, ...).
	- Extended pcregion with the ability to initialize a pccamera to
	  a given starting position. Also extended pcregion with the ability
	  to go to a named starting position as opposed to only the default
	  one.
	- 'celtest' no longer has a pointer to the default view. It doesn't
	  even know what entity holds the view or camera.
	- Classic persistance module now writes a marker 'CEL0' in front
	  of the saved file. That makes it easier to recognize saved CEL
	  files.
	- Fixed the crash at exit in CEL by actually fixing a bug in CS :-)
	- Use the reporter for error reporting in classic persistance module.
	  Only for loading at this moment and only for the persistance module
	  itself. The individual property classes do not yet use the
	  reporter to report their errors.
	- Fixed a bug in pcregion loader.
	- Fixed a bug in pcmesh loader. Forgot to save the factory name
	  and properly initialize the mesh.
	- Implemented loading in CEL persistance module. At this moment loading
	  itself seems to work (i.e. it does not crash). However celtest
	  crashes right after loading so I have to investigate why.
	- Fixed a bad bug in pcmesh::SetMesh().
	- Added loading/saving of position of mesh. This doesn't fix the
	  loading problem though. Loading still crashes.
12-Nov-2001:
	- Created new cpersist plugin. This plugin will implement
	  'classic persistance' for CEL. This plugin does not do
	  anything at the moment except compile and register.
	- Philip Wyett updated the MSVC project files for the new
	  persistance plugin.
	- Added GetName() to iCelBehaviour. This is needed to be able
	  to save the associated behaviour name in the persistance layer.
	- Added GetFactoryName() to iCelPropertyClass. This is needed
	  to be able to save the associated factory name in the
	  persistance layer.
	- Worked on persistance a lot now. All property classes now have
	  full support for loading and saving (untested).
	- Implemented saving in the classic persistance plugin.
	  At this moment it doesn't work yet (crashes) and I also need
	  to implement a system to avoid saving the same entity or
	  property class twice or more then once.
	- Added 's' key to save the current world to 'savefile'. Since
	  saving in general does not work yet I advice you NOT to press
	  this key :-)
	- Fixed a bug in implementation of celDataBuffer. It was not
	  properly allocating new entries when the buffer growed.
	- Fixed handing of saving NULL property class or entity. Now
	  a marker is always saved which says what will follow. ENT0
	  is a NULL entity pointer. ENTI is the definition of an entity.
	  ENTR (not used yet) will be a reference to an entity.
	  Similar for property classes: PCL0, PCLI, and PCLR.
	- Fixed a bad bug in inventory saving.
	- The three fixes bug make sure that at least saving doesn't crash
	  anymore. However there is still too much information saved as
	  duplicate entities/property classes are not detected.
	- The current implementation of CEL/persistance assumes that
	  all entities have a unique name. I have to think more about this
	  issue (like having a unique name generation utility or something)
	  but in the mean time I fixed celtest so that the boxes have
	  a distinct name and also fixed bltest so that it only looks at the
	  first three letters of the name to see if an entity is a box (here
	  again we need a different way to detect this, maybe object classes?).
	- Entities and property classes are now only saved once. The second
	  time the same entity or property class comes back in the save
	  tree a reference is used.
11-Nov-2001:
	- Even though persistance is not operational yet I already
	  decided on a redesign. I removed the notion of 'named data
	  entries'. Everything works positional. It is now much simpler
	  and also allows for smaller persistant data. Additionally
	  I added the notion of a serial number for a databuffer. This
	  is useful for testing what version we are trying to load
	  and depending on that either rejecting the load or else trying
	  to convert the old data.
10-Nov-2001:
	- Further work on persistance. Not functional yet.
9-Nov-2001:
	- Fixed CELTEST for latest changes in CS (CreateEnvironment...).
	- Started working on pcregion property class. This property class
	  represents a region in the world.
	- 'pcregion' will automatically create individual entities for
	  all meshes in a world. These entities will get a pcmesh
	  and pcsolid property class so that the collision detection system
	  works nicely. Note that there is a crash at exit in the destruction
	  of this. I have to investigate this later.
	- Changed celtest to use the new pcregion property class. It will now
	  load the partsys level from CS and put the entities there (boxes
	  and objects). Note that there are still several problems.
	  The 'pcmovable' does not yet support moving through portals so
	  don't try to drag an object out of the starting room yet or it
	  will drop through the floor.
	- Fixed a bug in the FindNearbyEntities(). Now it only returns
	  entities for meshes that are actually visible. Without this fix
	  it was very easy for objects to become stuck after too much
	  box/object manipulations. Now it is still not perfect but a lot
	  better already. An object in the box no longer affects collision
	  detection of objects not in the box.
8-Nov-2001:
	- Started work on persistance. Nothing works yet. Created
	  iCelDataBuffer which the persistance system will use to save/load
	  information.
	- Slightly changed prototype of Load() and Save() so that they
	  now expect a pointer to the data buffer on which they must operate.
	- Added stub code for persistance to all property classes.
	- Fixed a bug in the gravity property class which could cause
	  celtest to hang on very fast systems.
	- Added iCelPersistance interface.
6-Nov-2001:
	- Started work on 'pcgravity' property class (in 'pfmove' factory).
	  This property class is an almost exact copy of the movable property
	  class from Dreams Eternal. It implements primitive gravity
	  for objects. It also has an ApplyForce so you can apply a force
	  in any direction.
	- Added 'Move' to iPcMovable which will do a relative move.
	  This routine will also correctly update the current sector if
	  a portal is traversed.
	- Cleaned up celtest a little.
	- Right clicking on a box opens/closes it (that was already the
	  case yesterday). If you now right-click on the box to open it
	  all objects that are in the box will jump out (using a force
	  and gravity).
	- Added a timer property class to 'pftools'. The message
	  'timer_wakeup' will be sent to the Behaviour.
	- The timer is now used by the box so that the entities in the box
	  are thrown out of the box one by one. Gives a nice effect :-)
	- Added a few more objects and boxes to celtest.
	- Note that gravity is not perfect yet. It is rather easy to get
	  everything stuck. It would be nice to have the ability to push
	  objects while dragging them.
	- Removed the now obsolete conf_mingw.mak.
5-Nov-2001:
	- Added a box mesh object for celtest.
	- Made four dummy objects visible. Changed selection code in
	  celtest so that the room behaviour will now control selection
	  and dragging of all other objects.
	- Added conveniance iPcMesh::SetAction() function which will
	  work if the mesh is a 3D sprite.
	- Added 'box' behaviour to 'bltest'.
	- Fixed a bug in 'pcmeshsel' where it would not deselect the entity
	  if follow mode is unset (the default).
	- Added Show(), Hide(), and IsVisible() to iPcMesh.
	- Added iCelPlLayer::GetHitEntity() to find the entity on a specific
	  screen position.
	- Added iPcCamera for a property class representation of a camera.
	- Added 'pfengine' factory with engine related property classes.
	  Currently it only contains 'pccamera'.
	- Added general superclass for all behaviours in bltest.
	- It is now possible to drag objects on the box. If they fit they
	  will be added. It is not yet possible to get them out the box
	  and they will also be added if the box is closed.
4-Nov-2001:
	- Wouter Wijngaards did the following:
	    - CEL makefile now uses the new cs-config --makevars option.
	      This should make the conf_*.maks superfluous.
	    - The makefile is also updated to be an adapted copy of the
	      new template makefile in CS.
	    - Tested on linux, and removed conf_linux.mak.
	    - If it works on mingw too that .mak can also be removed.
	  How to work with the new makefile?
	  Simply update your CS, and copy the new (make csconfig) cs-config
	  script to the cel directory. csconfig.mak depends on the cs-config
	  script, so it should be remade when you next make depend or make all.
3-Nov-2001:
	- 'pcinventory' sends an 'inv_addchild' messages to the entity
	  containing the inventory when an entity is added.
	- 'pcinventory' sends an 'inv_added' messages to the entity
	  that is being added.
	- Also added 'inv_removechild' and 'inv_removed' messages.
2-Nov-2001:
	- Added iPcMesh::CreateEmptyThing() which can be used instead
	  of SetMesh().
	- Changed celtest so that 'room' is now also an entity and uses
	  pcmesh property class for the room walls.
	- Added iCelPlLayer::AttachEntity(), UnattachEntity(), and
	  FindAttachedEntity(). This functionality used to be present
	  ad-hoc in the pcmesh property class but it is generally useful.
	  Using those functions property classes can attach an entity
	  to some iObject (usually an engine object).
	- Changed pcmesh to use the new iCelPlLayer::AttachEntity()
	  functions.
	- Changed celtest to load the pl/bl plugins using CS_REQUEST_PLUGIN
	  so that they are registered to the object registry.
	- Actually implemented the 'global' option in pcmeshselect. I
	  forgot to do that earlier.
	- After adding an object to an inventory it is usually best
	  to call DecRef() as the inventory now holds a reference
	  (unless you also need to have the reference). Changed celtest
	  for this. Unfortunatelly this does not fix the ref leaks in
	  celtest yet.
	- Added iPcSolid which is a property class that is going to be
	  used for collision detection. iPcSolid is implemented by
	  the 'pfmove' factory.
	- Added iPcMovableConstraint and extended iPcMovable so that you can
	  add constraints.
	- Extended 'pfmove' factory with pcmovableconst_cd implementation of
	  iPcMovableConstraint which uses iPcSolid to implement a constraint
	  based on collision detection. This implementation is currently
	  not operational yet.
	- Added iCelEntityList and celEntityList implementation in plimp.
	- Added iCelPlLayer::FindNearbyEntities() which will return a list
	  of all entities within a certain radius of a given position.
	  This function will use the attached entities to find the
	  entities from the engine objects.
	- Partially implemented 'pcmovableconst_cd' so that it actually
	  uses collision detection but it has the following two shortcomings:
	    - Movement either succeeds or fails. There is no partial result.
	    - A path between start and end should be used for collision
	      detection. Now only the end position is checked which means
	      that objects at high speed may actually pass through walls.
	  In practice this limitation means that in celtest when you drag
	  the object, it will only temporarily be blocked by the walls. If
	  you drag further it will go through.
	- Collision detection with 'pcmovableconst_cd' works better in the
	  sense that it is no longer possible to go through walls. A
	  one-triangle collider with the size of the path is used to
	  detect collisions along the movement path.
	- Philip Wyett updated MSVC project files for CEL.
	- Added iPcMeshSelect::SetFollowAlwaysMode(). When this is true
	  move messages will be send whenever the mouse is over an entity
	  regardless of selection.
	- Added a new behaviour class to bltest for the 'room'. Added
	  a new pcmeshselect property classes to the room entity which
	  has follow-always set to true.
	- Added new 'pftools' factory. This will contain general tools.
	  The only tool it now contains is a 'pctooltip' property class
	  for displaying tooltips. This property class is not functional
	  yet.
	- Implemented tooltips.
	- Celtest now shows tooltip for the object over which the mouse
	  rests.
	- Fixed a bug in 'pcmeshsel' when the mouse was over nothing.
1-Nov-2001:
	- Slightly changed the way that csconfig.mak works.
	- Implemented dragging. You can define a plane on which the
	  object will be constrained while dragging. This plane can
	  be defined in either camera or world space giving maximum
	  control.
	- Modified celtest with a demo of this dragging. With left
	  mouse button you will drag to the 0,1,0 plane in world space.
	  This means orthogonal to the floor. With right mouse
	  button you will drag to the 0,0,1 plane in camera space.
	- Added 'pfmove' factory and implemented iPcMovable. At this
	  moment this property class is only a thin wrapper on top
	  of moving an iPcMesh directly but in the future it will
	  be able to contrain movement by using attached
	  iPcMovableConstraint property classes (not implemented yet).
	- Extended iPcMeshSelect so it will by default look for a movable.
	  If that cannot be find it will look for an iPcMesh instead (old
	  behaviour).
31-Oct-2001:
	- Split 'selectmesh' message from 'pcmeshselect' property class
	  'selectmesh_up' and 'selectmesh_down'.
	- Added a lot more control to iPcMeshSelect interface. Now you can
	  indicate if you want 'follow' mode or not. With follow mode the
	  mouse will track the selected object and immediatelly send
	  up/down messages when the mouse leaves/enters the object.
	  Otherwise an 'up' message is only sent when the mouse button
	  goes up regardless of the position of the mouse.
	  Also added the ability to disable up/down mouse events if you
	  don't need them.
	  Added a few other functions that are not yet implemented (dragging).
	- Fixed a missing DecRef() in the destructor of 'pcmeshselect'
	  property class.
	- Optimized 'pcmeshselect' by only registering the event handler
	  for the right events depending on the settings. i.e. don't listen
	  to mouse move events if you are not dragging or in follow mode.
	- Added the ability to control for which mouse buttons you want
	  to use 'pcmeshselect'. By default it will only react on mouse
	  button one. You can use multiple 'pcmeshselect' property classes
	  on one entity to have different behaviour depending on the mouse
	  button.
30-Oct-2001:
	- Renamed iCelBlEntity to iCelBehaviour and made the corresponding
	  changes throughout the project (i.e. CreateBlEntity->CreateBehaviour
	  and so on...).
	- Added iBase* parameter to iCelBehaviour::SendMessage(). So a
	  message from property classes to the behaviour part of an entity
	  now has three parts:
	  	- A message id.
		- An iBase pointer with possible additional arguments
		  for the message.
		- A list of additional strings.
	- Removed several bugs in cleanup of inventory which prevented proper
	  cleanup. In particular RemoveAll() was not right.
	- Extended pcmesh property class so that a csObject is attached
	  to the mesh in the engine with which it is possible to find the
	  entity again.
	- The 'pcmeshselect' property class now sends a 'selectmesh' message
	  to the behaviour. 'bltest' reacts on this message and prints out
	  the selected entity (try clicking on the small object in celtest).
	- Added declarations for FAST SCF queries to include/pl/pl.h.
	- Extended 'pcmeshselect' property class with the ability to switch
	  between 'global' and 'local' selection. Local selection is default
	  and this means that the Behaviour will only get messages when
	  it's own mesh is selected. With global selection the Behaviour
	  will get messages on selection of all meshes.
	- Added a few additional FAST declarations for SCF.
29-Oct-2001:
	- Basic inventory handling seems to work now. Celtest demonstrates
	  (in text form only at the moment) one box entity and four
	  dummy entities. Two of them fit and the two others don't.
	  Some provisions are made for inherited characteristics
	  but this is not fully implemented yet.
	- Added iCelPropertyClassList::FindByInterface() to return the
	  property class implementing some interface. Also added
	  CEL_QUERY_PROPCLASS which is a define to make this easier.
	- Changing of property values is now properly restricted by
	  the parent inventory and the new values are also propagated
	  to the inventory.
	- Inherited characteristics now work. It is possible to modify
	  the characteristic of the contents (i.e. for the NetHack
	  Bag of Holding which reduces the weight of all objects inside).
	- Small optimization on GetInheritedCharProperty(). If factor is very
	  close to 0 it will not ask characteristics of inventory.
	- Fixed 'make clean' target.
	- Completely rewrote the inventory checking system. Now it
	  may be *slightly* less optimal (but only slightly) but it
	  is MUCH more robust and easier to understand. It is also completely
	  safe now. Unless there are bugs in the code there is NO
	  way to have an inventory with contents that doesn't satisfy
	  the inventory constraints:
	      - You are not allowed to change constraints for an
	        inventory while objects are in the inventory that
		violate that constraint.
	      - You are not allowed to add/remove entities to an
	        inventory if that would violate constraints.
	      - You are not allowed to change characteristics of
	        an entity if that would violate constraints of
		parent inventories.
	  If I made no bugs the system should be water-tight.
	- Added a new property class 'pcmeshselect' to the 'pfmesh'
	  property class factory. With this property class the behaviour
	  layer will be notified when a mesh is selected. At this
	  moment this property class works but doesn't send a
	  message to the BL yet.
	- Eric Sunshine enabled CVS update notification via the cel-cvs-update
	  mailing list.
28-Oct-2001:
	- Started work on the 'pfmesh' factory. This factory will support
	  the 'pcmesh' property class so that you can attach a mesh object
	  with an entity.
	- 'celtest' now shows an entity that has a mesh attached to it.
	- Started work on the 'pvinv' factory for inventories. This inventory
	  supports two property classes: 'pcinventory' and 'pccharacteristics'.
	  The 'pccharacteristics' is typically used for entities that are
	  put in the inventory. The entity that has the inventory
	  property class will use the characteristics to see if the object
	  fits in the inventory.
	- Fixed a bug with current constraints not being updated correctly
	  when entities are removed from the inventory.
	- Constraints where not cleaned up at destruction time.
	- Constraints are now also checked when properties change. i.e. it
	  is impossible to change a property when the entity is in an
	  inventory and changing that property would cause the inventory
	  constraints to be invalidated. Not fully implemented yet!
	  We also still have to define hierarchical constraints (i.e. for
	  nested inventories).
	- Philip Wyett created/added MSVC project files for the CEL project.
27-Oct-2001:
	- Updated csconfig.mak with entries for linux. Uncomment the
	  entries suitable for your system.
	- Changed the executable name for celtest to celtst. Otherwise
	  it would be the same as the directory name on linux.
	- Implemented first bl entity in 'bltest'. No functionality yet.
	- Added definition of iCelMessage.
	- Added iCelPlLayer::CreateMessage().
	- Added implementation of iCelMessage to plimp. Unfinished.
	- Changed iCelBlEntity so that targetted messages to an entity
	  no longer use iCelMessage but directly pass the information
	  to the bl entity.
	- Further work on bltest and celtest. A message is now printed.
26-Oct-2001:
	- Added iCelPropertyClassFactory interface. A property class
	  factory is responsible for creation of property classes. Every
	  factory will handle a number of property class types.
	- Extended iCelPlLayer with a number of methods to register and
	  query property class factories.
	- Added include/pf dir which will contain public SCF interfaces
	  for specific property class factories. Added include/pf/test.h
	  which will be a test interface for our test property class
	  factory.
	- Added 'pf/test' dir which will contain the implementation of the
	  'test' factory. This resuls in the third plugin.
	- Added temporary code to celtest so the plugins of CEL are registered.
	  In the (near) future we will define a better solution for this
	  problem on the CS side (removal of scf.cfg).
	- 'celtest' now loads the three CEL plugins (plimp, bltest, and
	  pftest) and uses them. It all seems to work nicely but there is
	  no real functionality yet.
	- Added 'name' parameter to iCelBlLayer::CreateBlEntity().
	- Started adding support for 'printer' behaviour entity in 'bltest'.
24-Oct-2001:
	- Added the very first code for CEL. Today I added:
	    - The include files for PL and BL. These are SCF interfaces.
	    - The start of PLIMP which is the implementation of the PL.
	    - The start of CELTEST which is a test application for CEL.
	  The test application works (i.e. it opens a CS window) but other
	  than that there is nothing functional yet.
	- Fixed a bug in factory definition of 'plimp'.
	- Started work on 'bltest'.
