Python widgets for CEL by cfraz89
This is a collection of 'widgets' which allow the user to interact
with your python program by sending messages on certain events. They are not
quite complete, however they should be somewhat usable. They may need to be
copied and customised, or subclassed, if something doesn't go with what you 
need. If this is the case, please contact me so I can improve these widgets.

The interface to these widgets is the celMenu module, which is created as such.

menu = celMenu(attachedentity)

Then the widgets can be added using addElement().
