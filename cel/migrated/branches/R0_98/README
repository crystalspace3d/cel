This is the Crystal Entity Layer (CEL).
http://cel.sourceforge.net/

For Unix, MSYS/Mingw, or Cygwin:

To compile all CEL plugins and applications, perform the following steps:

1. Install Crystal Space (latest CVS version) or else point
   the CRYSTAL environment variable to where you built Crystal Space.
2. Type ./configure (./configure --enable-debug if you want debug mode).
3. Type 'jam'.

Microsoft Visual C++ 7 users need to open "msvc/wkscel.sln" ("msvc/wkscel.dsw"
for MSVC6). Then, make sure the have set both paths to the CS include and
library directories.  For more information see the HOWTO into the Crystal Space
docs "Creating an External MSVC Application".  After doingso, set each of the
projects as the active one and compile.
