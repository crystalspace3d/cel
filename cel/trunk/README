This is the Crystal Entity Layer (CEL).
http://cel.sourceforge.net/

For Unix, Unix, MSYS/Mingw or Cygwin:

To compile all CEL plugins and applications, perform the following steps:

1. Install Crystal Space (latest CVS version) or else point
   the CRYSTAL environment variable to where you built Crystal Space.
2. Type ./configure (./configure --enable-debug if you want debug mode).
3. Type 'jam'.

Microsoft Visual C++ 7 users need to open "cel.sln" ("cel.dsw for MSVC6) then
make sure the have set both paths to the CS include and lib files.  For more
info see the HOWTO into the Crystal Space docs "Creating an External MSVC
Application".  After completing this, set each of the projects as the active
one and compile.
