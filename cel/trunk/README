For Unix, GNU/Linux, MSYS/Mingw or Cygwin:
To compile all CEL plugins and applications you must do the following steps:
	1. Install Crystal Space (latest CVS version) or else point
	   the CRYSTAL environment variable to where you put Crystal Space.
	2. Type ./configure (./configure --enable-debug if you want
	   debug mode).
	3. Type 'jam'.

Microsoft Visual C++ users need to open "cel.dsw" then make sure the
have set both paths to the CS include and lib files. For more info
see the HOWTO into the Crystal Space docs "Creating an External
MSVC Application". After completing this, set each of the projects as
the active one and compile.
