29-Oct-2001:
	- Basic inventory handling seems to work now. Celtest demonstrates
	  (in text form only at the moment) one box entity and four
	  dummy entities. Two of them fit and the two others don't.
	  Some provisions are made for inherited characteristics
	  but this is not fully implemented yet.
	- Added iCelPropertyClassList::FindByInterface() to return the
	  property class implementing some interface. Also added
	  CEL_QUERY_PROPCLASS which is a define to make this easier.
	- Changing of property values is now properly restricted by
	  the parent inventory and the new values are also propagated
	  to the inventory.
	- Inherited characteristics now work. It is possible to modify
	  the characteristic of the contents (i.e. for the NetHack
	  Bag of Holding which reduces the weight of all objects inside).
	- Small optimization on GetInheritedCharProperty(). If factor is very
	  close to 0 it will not ask characteristics of inventory.
	- Fixed 'make clean' target.
	- Completely rewrote the inventory checking system. Now it
	  may be *slightly* less optimal (but only slightly) but it
	  is MUCH more robust and easier to understand. It is also completely
	  safe now. Unless there are bugs in the code there is NO
	  way to have an inventory with contents that doesn't satisfy
	  the inventory constraints:
	      - You are not allowed to change constraints for an
	        inventory while objects are in the inventory that
		violate that constraint.
	      - You are not allowed to add/remove entities to an
	        inventory if that would violate constraints.
	      - You are not allowed to change characteristics of
	        an entity if that would violate constraints of
		parent inventories.
	  If I made no bugs the system should be water-tight.
28-Oct-2001:
	- Started work on the 'pfmesh' factory. This factory will support
	  the 'pcmesh' property class so that you can attach a mesh object
	  with an entity.
	- 'celtest' now shows an entity that has a mesh attached to it.
	- Started work on the 'pvinv' factory for inventories. This inventory
	  supports two property classes: 'pcinventory' and 'pccharacteristics'.
	  The 'pccharacteristics' is typically used for entities that are
	  put in the inventory. The entity that has the inventory
	  property class will use the characteristics to see if the object
	  fits in the inventory.
	- Fixed a bug with current constraints not being updated correctly
	  when entities are removed from the inventory.
	- Constraints where not cleaned up at destruction time.
	- Constraints are now also checked when properties change. i.e. it
	  is impossible to change a property when the entity is in an
	  inventory and changing that property would cause the inventory
	  constraints to be invalidated. Not fully implemented yet!
	  We also still have to define hierarchical constraints (i.e. for
	  nested inventories).
	- Philip Wyett created/added MSVC project files for the CEL project.
27-Oct-2001:
	- Updated csconfig.mak with entries for linux. Uncomment the
	  entries suitable for your system.
	- Changed the executable name for celtest to celtst. Otherwise
	  it would be the same as the directory name on linux.
	- Implemented first bl entity in 'bltest'. No functionality yet.
	- Added definition of iCelMessage.
	- Added iCelPlLayer::CreateMessage().
	- Added implementation of iCelMessage to plimp. Unfinished.
	- Changed iCelBlEntity so that targetted messages to an entity
	  no longer use iCelMessage but directly pass the information
	  to the bl entity.
	- Further work on bltest and celtest. A message is now printed.
26-Oct-2001:
	- Added iCelPropertyClassFactory interface. A property class
	  factory is responsible for creation of property classes. Every
	  factory will handle a number of property class types.
	- Extended iCelPlLayer with a number of methods to register and
	  query property class factories.
	- Added include/pf dir which will contain public SCF interfaces
	  for specific property class factories. Added include/pf/test.h
	  which will be a test interface for our test property class
	  factory.
	- Added 'pf/test' dir which will contain the implementation of the
	  'test' factory. This resuls in the third plugin.
	- Added temporary code to celtest so the plugins of CEL are registered.
	  In the (near) future we will define a better solution for this
	  problem on the CS side (removal of scf.cfg).
	- 'celtest' now loads the three CEL plugins (plimp, bltest, and
	  pftest) and uses them. It all seems to work nicely but there is
	  no real functionality yet.
	- Added 'name' parameter to iCelBlLayer::CreateBlEntity().
	- Started adding support for 'printer' behaviour entity in 'bltest'.
24-Oct-2001:
	- Added the very first code for CEL. Today I added:
	    - The include files for PL and BL. These are SCF interfaces.
	    - The start of PLIMP which is the implementation of the PL.
	    - The start of CELTEST which is a test application for CEL.
	  The test application works (i.e. it opens a CS window) but other
	  than that there is nothing functional yet.
	- Fixed a bug in factory definition of 'plimp'.
	- Started work on 'bltest'.
