24-Oct-2001:
	- Added the very first code for CEL. Today I added:
	    - The include files for PL and BL. These are SCF interfaces.
	    - The start of PLIMP which is the implementation of the PL.
	    - The start of CELTEST which is a test application for CEL.
	  The test application works (i.e. it opens a CS window) but other
	  than that there is nothing functional yet.
	- Fixed a bug in factory definition of 'plimp'.
	- Started work on 'bltest'.
26-Oct-2001:
	- Added iCelPropertyClassFactory interface. A property class
	  factory is responsible for creation of property classes. Every
	  factory will handle a number of property class types.
	- Extended iCelPlLayer with a number of methods to register and
	  query property class factories.
	- Added include/pf dir which will contain public SCF interfaces
	  for specific property class factories. Added include/pf/test.h
	  which will be a test interface for our test property class
	  factory.
	- Added 'pf/test' dir which will contain the implementation of the
	  'test' factory. This resuls in the third plugin.
	- Added temporary code to celtest so the plugins of CEL are registered.
	  In the (near) future we will define a better solution for this
	  problem on the CS side (removal of scf.cfg).
	- 'celtest' now loads the three CEL plugins (plimp, bltest, and
	  pftest) and uses them. It all seems to work nicely but there is
	  no real functionality yet.
	- Added 'name' parameter to iCelBlLayer::CreateBlEntity().
	- Started adding support for 'printer' behaviour entity in 'bltest'.
27-Oct-2001:
	- Updated csconfig.mak with entries for linux. Uncomment the
	  entries suitable for your system.
	- Changed the executable name for celtest to celtst. Otherwise
	  it would be the same as the directory name on linux.
	- Implemented first bl entity in 'bltest'. No functionality yet.
	- Added definition of iCelMessage.
	- Added iCelPlLayer::CreateMessage().
	- Added implementation of iCelMessage to plimp. Unfinished.
	- Changed iCelBlEntity so that targetted messages to an entity
	  no longer use iCelMessage but directly pass the information
	  to the bl entity.
	- Further work on bltest and celtest. A message is now printed.
28-Oct-2001:
	- Started work on the 'pfmesh' factory. This factory will support
	  the 'pcmesh' property class so that you can attach a mesh object
	  with an entity.
	- 'celtest' now shows an entity that has a mesh attached to it.
	- Started work on the 'pvinv' factory for inventories. This inventory
	  supports two property classes: 'pcinventory' and 'pccharacteristics'.
	  The 'pccharacteristics' is typically used for entities that are
	  put in the inventory. The entity that has the inventory
	  property class will use the characteristics to see if the object
	  fits in the inventory.
