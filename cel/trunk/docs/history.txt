24-Oct-2001:
	- Added the very first code for CEL. Today I added:
	    - The include files for PL and BL. These are SCF interfaces.
	    - The start of PLIMP which is the implementation of the PL.
	    - The start of CELTEST which is a test application for CEL.
	  The test application works (i.e. it opens a CS window) but other
	  than that there is nothing functional yet.
	- Fixed a bug in factory definition of 'plimp'.
	- Started work on 'bltest'.
26-Oct-2001:
	- Added iCelPropertyClassFactory interface. A property class
	  factory is responsible for creation of property classes. Every
	  factory will handle a number of property class types.
	- Extended iCelPlLayer with a number of methods to register and
	  query property class factories.
	- Added include/pf dir which will contain public SCF interfaces
	  for specific property class factories. Added include/pf/test.h
	  which will be a test interface for our test property class
	  factory.
	- Added 'pf/test' dir which will contain the implementation of the
	  'test' factory. This resuls in the third plugin.
	- Added temporary code to celtest so the plugins of CEL are registered.
	  In the (near) future we will define a better solution for this
	  problem on the CS side (removal of scf.cfg).
	- 'celtest' now loads the three CEL plugins (plimp, bltest, and
	  pftest) and uses them. It all seems to work nicely but there is
	  no real functionality yet.
	- Added 'name' parameter to iCelBlLayer::CreateBlEntity().
	- Started adding support for 'printer' behaviour entity in 'bltest'.
