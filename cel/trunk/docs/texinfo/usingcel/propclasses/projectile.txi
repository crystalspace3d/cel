@subsubheading General Information

PcProjectile can be used to handle projectiles in an easy way.
It can be set to go in some direction, and will send a
@code{pcprojectile_hit} message to the behaviour when it hits
something. To start movement the @code{Start} api function or cel
action must be used.

Maximum distance and maximum hits can be specified, and when either of
both is reached a @code{pcprojectile_stopped} message will be sent to
the behaviour. 

PcProjectile depends on having pclinmove and pcmesh present on the entity
to work.
