For Unix, MSYS/Mingw, or Cygwin:

To compile all CEL plugins and applications, perform the following steps:

1. Install Crystal Space (latest SVN version) or else point
   the CRYSTAL environment variable to where you built Crystal Space.
2. Type ./configure (./configure --enable-debug if you want debug mode).
3. Type 'jam'.

Microsoft Visual C++ 7 users need to open "msvc/wkscel.sln" ("msvc/wkscel.dsw"
for MSVC6). Then, make sure the have set both paths to the CS include and
library directories.  For more information see the HOWTO into the Crystal Space
manual "Creating an External MSVC Application".  After doing so, set each of
the "grpcel" project as the active one and compile.
