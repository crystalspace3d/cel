To compile PLIMP and CELTEST you first must run 'make csconfig'
from the Crystal Space dir and copy the cs-config script to this dir.
Then edit the csconfig.mak file unless you are on Linux. In future
this will be automated.

Microsoft Visual C++ users need to open "cel.dsw" then make sure the
have set both paths to the CS include and lib files. For more info
see the HOWTO into the Crystal Space docs "5.7.10 Creating an External
MSVC Application". After completing this, set each of the projects as
the active one and compile.
