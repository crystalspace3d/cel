# The 'manual' and 'api' subdirectories are generated automatically by
# jobber.pl on a daily basis. That script processes and knows about generated
# files only, and will correctly 'cvs add' and 'cvs remove' items from those
# directories as required.  Consequently, we can not have Jamfiles in those
# directories (since jobber.pl would "cvs remove" them because they are not
# "generated").  Therefore, we perform tasks for those subdirectories here
# instead.
