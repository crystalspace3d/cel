 * - SetCamera: parameters 'entity' (string).
 * - SetMouseButtons: parameters 'buttons' (string or long). In case
 *     of string it should be a string with 'l', 'm', or 'r' (or a combination).
 * - SetDragPlaneNormal: parameters 'normal' (vector3), 'camera' (bool).

 * - global (bool, read/write): global selection, default false.
 * - follow (bool, read/write): follow mode, default false.
 * - followalways (bool, read/write): follow always mode, default false.
 * - drag (bool, read/write): drag mode, default false.

 * - senddown (bool, read/write): send down events, default true.
