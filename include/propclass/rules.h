/**
 * This property class represents a set of active rules for an entity.
 * It uses the rule base system (iCelRuleBase). Note that this property class
 * will automatically load the rule base system if it is missing.
 * When reading properties out of this pcrules it will check if there are
 * any rules affecting the property. If not you will simply get the value
 * from the associated 'pcproperties' property class (if present). Otherwise
 * you will get a modified value according to the rules defined for this
 * property (starting from the value out of pcproperties). If the 'pcproperties'
 * is not present a default value is assumed (0 for numbers, empty string
 * for string, 0-vector for vectors, and black for colors).
 *
 * This property class can send out the following messages
 * to the behaviour:
 * - pcrules_modifypar: a parameter has been modified: parameters
 *     'name' (name of the parameter).
 *
 * This property class supports the following actions:
 * - AddRule: parameters 'name' (string). Optional 'time' (long) parameter.
 * - DeleteRule: parameters 'name' (string).
 * - DeleteAllRules: no parameters.
