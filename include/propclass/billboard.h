/**
 * Billboard property class.
 *
 * This property class can send out the following messages
 * to the behaviour:
 * - pcbillboard_select: billboard is selected (x,y,button)
 * - pcbillboard_move: mouse moves over billboard (x,y,button)
 * - pcbillboard_moveaway: mouse moves away from billboard (x,y,button)
 * - pcbillboard_unselect: billboard is unselected (x,y,button)
 * - pcbillboard_doubleclick: billboard is double clicked (x,y,button)
 *
 * This property class supports the following actions:
 * - DrawMesh: parameters 'materialname' (string),
 *     'factory' (string), optional: 'distance' (float),
 *     optional: 'rotate' (vector3), optional: 'angle' (float).
 * - GetTextWidth: no parameters, returns an integer with current text width
 *   in billboard coordinates.
 * - GetTextHeight: no parameters, returns an integer with current text height
 *   in billboard coordinates.
 *
 * This property class supports the following properties:
 * - name (string, read/write): name of the billboard.
 * - materialname (string, read/write): name of the material. Warning!
 *     It is important to make sure the materials using the billboard
 *     have the <keepimage/> flag set!
 * - materialnamefast (string, read/write): name of the material (faster
 *     way to set).
 * - clickable (bool, read/write): clickable (default no).
 * - movable (bool, read/write): movable (default no).
 * - visible (bool, read/write): visible (default yes).
 * - restack (bool, read/write): restackable on selection (default no).
 * - sendmove (bool, read/write): send move/moveaway events (default no).
 * - color (color, read/write): color of this billboard.
 * - width (long, read/write): width of this billboard.
 * - height (long, read/write): height of this billboard.
 * - widthpct (float, read/write): width of this billboard in percentage.
 * - heightpct (float, read/write): height of this billboard in percentage.
 * - x (long, read/write): x position of this billboard.
 * - y (long, read/write): y position of this billboard.
 * - uv_topleft (vector2, read/write): topleft uv coordinate in material.
 * - uv_botright (vector2, read/write): botright uv coordinate in material.
 * - layer (string, read/write): layer name.
 * - text (string, read/write): optional text on billboard.
 * - text_offset (vector2, read/write): offset for text in billboard space.
 * - text_fg_color (color, read/write): foreground color.
 * - text_bg_color (color, read/write): background color.
 * - text_font_size (float, read/write): font size. Set this before setting
 *     text_font. Otherwise default is 10.
 * - text_font (string, read/write): font.
 * - text_default_fg_color (color, read/write): default foreground color (for
 *     all billboards).
 * - text_default_bg_color (color, read/write): default background color (for
 *     all billboards).
 * - text_default_font_size (float, read/write): font size. Set this before
 *     setting text_default_font. Otherwise default is 10.
 * - text_default_font (string, read/write): default font (for
 *     all billboards).
