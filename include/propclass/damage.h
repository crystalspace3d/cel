/**
 * This is a property class for damage emitting. Attach this property
 * class to entities that can cause damage to other entities. Causing
 * damage is basically a matter of sending a message to the affected
 * entities. The affecting entity will have to handle the damage in whatever
 * way is appropriate.
 *
 * This property class can send out the following messages
 * to the behaviour of affecting entities:
 * - pcdamage_hurt: damage has been done. Parameters: amount (float: amount
 *   of damage), source (string: name of source entity), sector (string:
 *   name of source sector), position (vector3: origin of damage),
 *   type (string: type of damage, application dependend).
 *
 * This property class supports the following actions (add prefix
 * 'cel.action.' to get the ID of the action):
 * - AreaDamage: 'radius' (float: default very large). In case of
 *   'normal' falloff this is actually ignored.
 * - BeamDamage: 'direction' (vector3), 'maxdist' (float: default very large).
 *   In case of 'normal' falloff the maxdist is ignored.
 * - SingleDamage: 'target' (string: name of target entity).
 *
 * This property class supports the following properties (add prefix
 * 'cel.property.' to get the ID of the property:
 * - amount (float, read/write): amount of damage to do.
 * - type (string, read/write): application dependend type of damage to do.
 * - sector (string, read/write): optional sector where the damage
 *   originates. If not given this will be obtained from the optionally
 *   attached pcmesh.
 * - position (vector3, read/write): optional vector where the damage
 *   originates. If not given this will be obtained from the optionally
 *   attached pcmesh.
 * - falloff (string, read/write): one of 'constant', 'normal', 'linear'.
