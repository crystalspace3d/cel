Give property classes names so you can distinguish between
property classes with same interface but different purpose.

Implement iPcMovable and iPcMovableConstraint. An iPcMovable
will be able to have pointers to several constraints.
Implement iPcMeshSelect so it moves the mesh through
the iPcMovable if present (if not present use iPcMesh
directly).
